* ClojureRS 

  Put simply, Clojure implemented atop Rust! My main goals here are 

** Project Goals:
  1. To create a version of Clojure that gets to exist independent of a particular platform  
  2. To explore a Clojure that, being more indepdent, has
     a. Proper tail call elimination 
     b. Conditions / Restarts 
     c. Any other feature it might not normally be able to indulge 
  3. To, should the project progress,  begin looking more serious into advanced compilation techniques,
     to create a serious Clojure implementation 

     Check clojureRS.org (the file, not website) for more notes about
     the design of the language, which should grow as the program
     grows.

** Personal Goals:
  1. Work a bit closer to the metal, and do so with Rust, two pleaures of mine
  2. Work more with compilation, another pleasure  
  3. Give myself a functional lisp to script with -- but not
     necessarily because of any issue with our other clojure-scripting
     options
